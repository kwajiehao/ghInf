  tau_a = 1, tau_b = 1, tau_c = 1, sigma_2 = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{number of nodes at level 1}

\item{j}{number of children nodes in level 2 per node at level 1}

\item{k}{number of children nodes in level 3 per node at level 2}

\item{ndraws}{number of samples the user wants to have}

\item{burnin}{number of samples to throw away at the start as the gibbs sampler warms up}

\item{flat_prior}{determines whether to use the density with flat prior}

\item{tau}{variance of the root (level 0)}

\item{tau_a}{variance for parameters in level 1}

\item{tau_b}{variance for parameters in level 2}

\item{tau_c}{variance for parameters in level 3}

\item{sigma_2}{variance of the observations}
}
\value{
list of means and the samples
}
\description{
Gibbs sampler for centered 3-level Gaussian hierarchical model according to derived full conditionals
}
\details{
Assumptions:
  - variances are constant for parameters within the same level
  - all observations y_ijk are equal to 0
  - the mean of the root parameter B is mu = 0
  - assume a naive sampler where the variances are not updated
}
